======================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIR, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

We used the measurements provided from [1]- number of measurements for every subject and every activity, to extract only mean and standard deviations. Since measurements were repeated, in the end only average value for every subject, measure and activity is calculated. 

The data set includes following files:
======================================================

- 'run_analysis.R' - script for getting tidy data frame from provided data

- 'data.txt' - final tidy data

- 'CodeBook.md' -decription of the data, variables and cleaning procedures

- 'README.txt'
